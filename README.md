Chrome extension to add key bindings mapped to layout changes. This could be a playground to experiment with new styles
before we decide to release to the public.

### Installation
This extension is currently only suitable for developer mode. 

1. In the Chrome extensions page check "Developer mode"
1. Next click "Load unpacked extension..." then choose the directory where this repo is cloned

### Usage

Alt-Shift-P - hide people pane and make timeline 70%

### TODO

* Add Incident timeline focus mode
* Up arrow to recall previous chat inputs
* Other ideas?
